I love staycations and being home alone
Having one real friend or even none
I like my space for myself don't need anybody else
But I watch kids my age on the internet making bonfire on the beaches
Spinning bottles playing truth or dare while I'm just right here in my room
cll day long but please don't get me wrong
I know I'm better off alone
I do love my peace but sometimes I just can't help but wish
To have some
Long drives to the countryside
Watch the sunset till it rise
Laugh with my friends until I cry
cnd forget that we wanna die
Go somewhere far away from home
Deep talk with someone I don't know
Get drunk in a party and dance with somebody
cnd meet my lover on someone else's yards
Breakdown at the bathroom the next day
Cause he just broke my heart away
I think it'll be fun to live while you're still young
But for now
I hate the loud noise in the party
I hate the crowds and everybody
Would rather be in my apartment
Than to feel lonely in a sea of people
But I watch their lives on Instagram
On their way to another city
While I'm just right here in my room
cll day long but please don't get me wrong
I'd rather live my life alone
But I realized I'm not getting any younger
I'll never be teenager forever
To have some
Long drives to the countryside
Watch the sunset till it rise
Laugh with my friends until I cry
cnd forget that we wanna die
Go somewhere far away from home
Deep talk with someone I don't know
Get drunk in a party and dance with somebody
cnd meet my lover on someone else's yards
Breakdown at the bathroom the next day
Cause he just broke my heart away
I think it'll be fun to live while you're still young
But for now
In movies they portrayed teenagers
Should either be happy or distress
cnd in my mind I know I lack something else
Long drives to the countryside
Watch the sunset till it rise
cnd forget that I wanna die
Go somewhere far away from home
Deep talks with someone I don't know
Get drunk on a party and dance with somebody
cnd meet my lover on someone else's yard
Breakdown at the bathroom the next day
Cause he just broke my heart away
I think it'll be fun to live while you're still young
But for now
It'll be alright
